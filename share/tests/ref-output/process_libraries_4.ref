* Test output: process_libraries_4
* Purpose: build a process library with an internal (pseudo) matrix element
*          No Makefile or code should be generated

* Initialize a process library with one entry (no external code)

* Configure library

* Compute MD5 sum

* Write makefile (no-op)

* Write driver source code (no-op)

* Write process source code (no-op)

* Compile (no-op)

* Link (no-op)

* Load (no-op)
