* Test output: event_streams_4
*   Purpose: handle in/out switching

* Generate test process event

* Allocate raw eio stream for writing

 Event stream array:
 Raw event stream:
   Check MD5 sum     = T
   Writing to file   = event_streams_4.evx

* Reallocate raw eio stream for reading

 Event stream array:
 Input stream:
 Raw event stream:
   Check MD5 sum     = T
   Reading from file = event_streams_4.evx

* Reallocate modified raw eio stream for reading (fail)

 Event stream array:
 Raw event stream:
   Check MD5 sum     = T
   Writing to file   = event_streams_4.evx

* Repeat ignoring checksum

 Event stream array:
 Input stream:
 Raw event stream:
   Check MD5 sum     = F
   Reading from file = event_streams_4.evx

* Test output end: event_streams_4
