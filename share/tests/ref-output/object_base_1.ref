* Test output: object_base_1
*   Purpose: elementary operations with objects

* Trivial object (tag): create, instantiate, display

object tag ||atom|| (1)
object tag ||atom|| (1)

* Object code:

 c= 1  vt= 0  nv= 0

* Cleanup:

obj1 allocated = F
obj2 allocated = F

* Test output end: object_base_1
