* Test output: dispatch_9
*   Purpose: allocate an event I/O (eio) stream

* Allocate as raw

 Raw event stream:
   Check MD5 sum     = T
   [closed]

* Allocate as checkpoints:

 Event-sample checkpoints:  off

* Allocate as LHEF:

 LHEF event stream:
   [closed]
   Keep beams        = F
   Keep remnants     = T
   Recover beams     = T
   Alpha_s from file = F
   Scale from file   = F
   Version           = 2.0
   File extension    = 'lhe_custom'

* Allocate as HepMC:

 HepMC event stream:
   [closed]
   Recover beams     = T
   Alpha_s from file = F
   Scale from file   = F
   File extension    = 'hepmc'

* Allocate as weight_stream

 Weight stream:
   [closed]

* Allocate as debug format

 ASCII event stream (Debugging format):
   [closed]
   Keep beams        = F
   Keep remnants     = T
   Show process      = T
   Show transforms   = T
   Show decay tree   = T
   Verbose output    = F

* Cleanup

* Test output end: dispatch_9
