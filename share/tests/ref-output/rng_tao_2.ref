* Test output: rng_tao_2
*   Purpose: initialize and use a rng factory

* Initialize factory

 RNG factory: tao (0,0)

* Make a generator

 TAO random-number generator:
   seed  = 0
   calls = 0

 x = 0.05465

* Repeat

 TAO random-number generator:
   seed  = 1
   calls = 0

 x = 0.28035

 RNG factory: tao (0,2)

* Initialize factory with different seed

 RNG factory: tao (1,0)

* Make a generator

 TAO random-number generator:
   seed  = 65536
   calls = 0

 x = 0.05092

 RNG factory: tao (1,1)

* Test output end: rng_tao_2
