* Test output: dispatch_11
*   Purpose: select QCD coupling formula

* Allocate alpha_s as fixed

   QCD parameters (fixed coupling):
     alpha =  1.17800E-01

* Allocate alpha_s as running (built-in)

   QCD parameters (running coupling):
     Scale mu  =  9.12340E+01
     alpha(mu) =  1.23400E-01
     LL order  = 1
     N(flv)    = 5

* Allocate alpha_s as running (built-in, Lambda defined)

   QCD parameters (Lambda_QCD as input):
     Lambda_QCD =  2.50000E-01
     LL order   = 2
     N(flv)     = 4

* Allocate alpha_s as running (using builtin PDF set)

   QCD parameters (pdf_builtin):
     PDF set = CTEQ6L
     PDF ID  = 3
