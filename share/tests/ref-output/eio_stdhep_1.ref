* Test output: eio_stdhep_1
*   Purpose: generate an event in STDHEP HEPEVT format
*      and write weight to file

* Initialize test process

* Generate and write an event

 STDHEP event stream:
   Writing to file   = eio_stdhep_1.hep
   Keep beams        = F
   Keep remnants     = T
   Recover beams     = F
   Alpha_s from file = F
   Scale from file   = F
   Numerical process IDs:
     1: 42

* Write STDHEP file contents to ASCII file


* Read in ASCII contents of STDHEP file
