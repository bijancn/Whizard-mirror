* Test output: Expressions
*   Purpose: test simple observable and node evaluation

* Setting a unary observable:

PDG =>  [int] = unary observable
Hel =>  [int] = unary observable
M =>  [real] = unary observable
M2 =>  [real] = unary observable
E =>  [real] = unary observable
Px =>  [real] = unary observable
Py =>  [real] = unary observable
Pz =>  [real] = unary observable
P =>  [real] = unary observable
Pl =>  [real] = unary observable
Pt =>  [real] = unary observable
Theta =>  [real] = unary observable
Phi =>  [real] = unary observable
Rap =>  [real] = unary observable
Eta =>  [real] = unary observable
Theta_RF =>  [real] = unary observable
Dist =>  [real] = unary observable
_User_obs_real =>  [real] = unary user observable
_User_obs_int =>  [int] = unary user observable
* Evaluating the observable node:

o PDG = [unknown integer]
      prt1 = prt(?)
* Cleanup


* Test output end: expressions_1
