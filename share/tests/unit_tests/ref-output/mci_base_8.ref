* Test output: mci_base_8
*   Purpose: check timer availability

* Initialize integrator with timer

 Test integrator:
   Time in seconds = [unknown]
   Number of channels   = 2
   Number of dimensions = 2
   Number of divisions  = 10

* Start timer

 Test integrator:
   Time in seconds = [running]
   Number of channels   = 2
   Number of dimensions = 2
   Number of divisions  = 10

* Stop timer

 (ok)

* Readout

 (ok)

* Deactivate timer

 Test integrator:
   Number of channels   = 2
   Number of dimensions = 2
   Number of divisions  = 10

* Cleanup

* Test output end: mci_base_8
