* Test output: mci_midpoint_7
*   Purpose: generate unweighted event with excess weight

* Initialize integrator

* Initialize instance

* Initialize test sampler

* Initialize random-number generator

* Integrate (determine maximum of integrand

 Single-channel midpoint rule integrator:
   Integral             = -3.4375000000E-01
   Efficiency           =  5.0000000000E-01
   Number of channels   = 1
   Number of dimensions = 1
   Number of bins       = 2
   Number of calls      = 2
     positive value     = 0
     zero value         = 1
     negative value     = 1
   Integral (pos. part) =  0.0000000000E+00
   Integral (neg. part) = -3.4375000000E-01
   Maximum of integrand =  0.0000000000E+00
   Minimum of integrand = -6.8750000000E-01
   Maximum (abs. value) =  6.8750000000E-01
   Minimum (abs. value) =  0.0000000000E+00
 Random-number generator: test (state = 1)

* Generate unweighted event

 x = 0.9000000000
 Integrand = -1.430000000000E+00
 Weight    =  1.000000000000E+00
 Excess    =  1.080000000000E+00
 Maximum   =  2.500000000000E-01
 Minimum   = -1.430000000000E+00
 Max.(abs) =  1.430000000000E+00
 Min.(abs) =  0.000000000000E+00

* Use getter methods

 weight = -1.430000000000E+00
 excess =  1.080000000000E+00

* Apply safety factor

* Generate unweighted event

 x = 0.9000000000
 Integrand = -1.430000000000E+00
 Weight    =  1.000000000000E+00
 Safety f  =  2.100000000000E+00
 Maximum   =  2.500000000000E-01
 Minimum   = -1.430000000000E+00
 Max.(abs) =  1.430000000000E+00
 Min.(abs) =  0.000000000000E+00

* Use getter methods

 weight = -1.430000000000E+00
 excess =  0.000000000000E+00

* Cleanup
