* Test output: mci_base_3
*   Purpose: perform a nontrivial test integral

* Initialize integrator

* Initialize instance

* Initialize test sampler

* Integrate

 Test integrator:
   Integral             =  1.0033750487E+00
   Number of channels   = 2
   Number of dimensions = 2
   Number of divisions  = 10

* Integrate with higher resolution

 Test integrator:
   Integral             =  1.0001533416E+00
   Number of channels   = 2
   Number of dimensions = 2
   Number of divisions  = 100

* Test output end: mci_base_3
