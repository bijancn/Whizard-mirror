* Test output: process_libraries_2
* Purpose: Construct a process definition list,
*          write it to file and reread it

* Construct a process definition list
*   First process definition: empty
*   Second process definition: two components
*     First component: empty
*     Second component: test data
*   Third process definition:
*     Embedded decays and polarization
