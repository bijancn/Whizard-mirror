* Test output: dispatch_7
*   Purpose: select and configure structure function data

* Allocate data as sf_pdf_builtin_t

 PDF builtin data:
   flavor       = f(2212)
   name         = CTEQ6L
   invert       = F
   has photon   = F
   mask         = T T T T T T * T * T T T T T T
   photon mask  = T
   hoppet_b     = F

 PDG(out) =  -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

* Allocate data for different PDF set

 PDF builtin data:
   flavor       = f(2212)
   name         = CTEQ6M
   invert       = F
   has photon   = F
   mask         = T T T T T T * T * T T T T T T
   photon mask  = T
   hoppet_b     = F

 PDG(out) =  -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
