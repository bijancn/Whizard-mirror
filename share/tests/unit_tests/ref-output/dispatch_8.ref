* Test output: dispatch_8
*   Purpose: configure a structure-function chain

* Allocate LHC beams with PDF builtin

 Structure-function configuration: beam(s) 1
 PDF builtin data:
   flavor       = f(2212)
   name         = CTEQ6L
   invert       = F
   has photon   = F
   mask         = T T T T T T * T * T T T T T T
   photon mask  = T
   hoppet_b     = F
 Structure-function configuration: beam(s) 2
 PDF builtin data:
