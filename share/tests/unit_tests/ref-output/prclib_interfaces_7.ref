* Test output: prclib_interfaces_7
*   Purpose: compile and link process library
*            with (fake) matrix-element code as a Fortran module
*            then clean up generated files

* Create a prclib driver object (1 process)
* Write makefile
* Write driver source code
* Write matrix-element source code
* Compile source code
* Link library
* File check
