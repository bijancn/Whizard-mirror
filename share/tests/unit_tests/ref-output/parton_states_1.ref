* Test output: parton_states_1
* Purpose: Test the standard parton states

* Using incoming flavors:
p(11) / p(-11)
* Two outgoing flavor structures:
p(1) / p(-1)
p(2) / p(-2)
* Initialize state matrix
* Fill state matrix

* Generated number of states: 32

* Setup interaction
* Init isolated state
* Give a trace to the isolated state

* Squared matrix element correct: T
* Give a matrix to the isolated state
* Sub-matrixelements correct:
* 1: T, 2: T
* Test output end: parton_states_1
