* Test output: prc_omega_4
*   Purpose: create a QCD process with OMega
*            and check alpha_s dependence

* Initialize a process library with one entry

* Configure and compile process

* Probe library API:

 is active = T

* Set parameters:

  alpha_s =   0.1178
  md      =   0.0000
  mu      =   0.0000
  ms      =   0.0000
  mc      =   0.0000
  mb      =   0.0000
  mtop    = 173.1000
  wtop    =   1.5230

* Set kinematics:

  p1 =   100.0     0.0     0.0   100.0
  p2 =   100.0     0.0     0.0  -100.0
  p3 =   100.0   100.0     0.0     0.0
  p4 =   100.0  -100.0     0.0     0.0

* Compute matrix element:

 is_allowed (1, 6, 1) = T
 |amp (1, 6, 1)| =  0.2467E+00

* Double alpha_s and compute matrix element again:

 is_allowed (1, 6, 1) = T
 |amp (1, 6, 1)| =  0.4934E+00

* Test output end: prc_omega_4
