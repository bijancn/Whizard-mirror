## Makefile.am -- Makefile for WHIZARD data files
##
## Process this file with automake to produce Makefile.in

## (Almost) empty dummy Makefile.am, because it is needed by make dist

# Used by a unit test, so distribute
EXTRA_DIST = test_beam_events.dat

# Other beam events files should be handled by the Makefile in the
# parent directory
