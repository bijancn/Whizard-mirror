(* Manipulate the power set, i.\,e.~the set of all subsets, of an
   set [Ordered_Type].  The concrete order is actually irrelevant, we just
   need it to construct [Set.S]s in the implementation.
   In fact, what we are implementating is the \textit{free semilattice}
   generated from the set of subsets of [Ordered_Type], where the join
   operation is the set union.

   The non trivial operation is [basis], which takes a set of subsets
   and returns the smallest set of disjoint subsets from which the argument
   can be reconstructed by forming unions.
   It is used in O'Mega for finding coarsest partitions of sets of
   partiticles.

   \begin{dubious}
     Eventually, this could be generalized from \textit{power set} or
     \textit{semi lattice} to \textit{lattice} with a notion of subtraction.
