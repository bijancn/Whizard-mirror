(* This datastructure describes large collections of trees with
   many shared nodes.  The sharing of nodes is semantically irrelevant,
   but can turn a factorial complexity to exponential complexity.
   Note that [DAG] implements only a very specialized subset of Directed
   Acyclical Graphs (DAGs). *)

(* If~$T(n,D)$ denotes the set of all binary trees with root~$n$
   encoded in~$D$, while
   \begin{equation}
     O(n,D)=\{(e_1,n_1,n_1'), \ldots, (e_k,n_k,n_k')\}
   \end{equation}
   denotes the set of all~\emph{offspring} of~$n$ in~$D$,
   and~$\text{tree}(e,t,t')$ denotes the binary tree formed by
   joining the binary trees~$t$ and~$t'$ with the label~$e$, then
   \begin{multline}
     T(n,D) = \bigl\{ \text{tree}(e_i,t_i,t_i')\,\bigl|\,
      (e_i,t_i,t_i')\in\{e_1\}\times T(n_1,D)\times T(n_1',D) \cup\ldots\\
             \ldots\cup\{e_k\}\times T(n_k,D)\times T(n_k',D) \bigr\}
   \end{multline}
   is the recursive definition of the binary trees encoded in~$D$.
   It is obvious how this definitions translates to $n$-ary trees
   (including trees with mixed arity). *)

(* We require edges and nodes to be members of ordered sets.
   The sematics of [compare] are compatible with [Pervasives.compare]:
   \begin{equation}
      \ocwlowerid{compare}(x,y) =
        \begin{cases}
          -1 & \text{for $x<y$} \\
          0 & \text{for $x=y$} \\
          1 & \text{for $x>y$}
        \end{cases}
   \end{equation}
   Note that this requirement does \emph{not} exclude any trees.
   Even if we consider only topological equivalence classes with
   anonymous nodes, we can always construct a canonical labeling
   and order from the children of the nodes.  However, if practical
   applications, we will often have more efficient labelings and
   orders at our disposal.  *)

(* A forest~$F$ over a set of nodes and a set of edges
   is a map from the set of nodes~$N$, to the direct product
   of the set of edges~$E$ and the power set $2^N$ of~$N$ augmented
   by a special element~$\bot$ (``bottom'').
   \begin{equation}
     \begin{aligned}
        F: N &\to (E \times 2^N) \cup \{\bot\} \\
           n &\mapsto \begin{cases}
                         (e, \{n'_1,n'_2,\ldots\}) \\
                         \bot
                      \end{cases}
     \end{aligned}
   \end{equation}
   The nodes are ordered so that cycles can be detected
   \begin{equation}
     \forall n\in N: F(n) = (e, x) \Rightarrow \forall n'\in x: n > n'
   \end{equation}
   A suitable function that exists for \emph{all} forests is the
   depth of the tree beneath a node.

   Nodes that are mapped to~$\bot$ are called \emph{leaf} nodes and
   nodes that do not appear in any~$F(n)$ are called \emph{root}
   nodes.  There are as many trees in the forest as there are root
   nodes. *)

   (e.\,g.~two and three for QCD) or even arbitrary arities.  However,
   in most cases, the members of~$X$ will have at least two members. *)

   added as by [add_node].  NB: Adding all nodes [n1] and [n2], even
