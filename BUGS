General:

* WHIZARD 2.4 currently runs only with the NAGFOR 6.0 (or newer) and 
  gfortran 4.8.5 (or newer) Fortran compilers as well as Intel ifort
  16.0.0 (or newer). Intel ifort 17.0.0/1 has a serious regression and
  does not work, however.

  [After compiler bugs are fixed, it should also run with PGF
   and pathscale.  See the file EXTENSIONS for the list of Fortran 2003 
   features that the compiler must support.]

* WHIZARD 2.4 incorporates all features from WHIZARD 1, making the
  legacy branch obsolete now.
  
* Please report bugs and problems or performance issues 
  to our support email address:
  <whizard@desy.de>

Known bugs:

* In version 2.3.0 there is a regression which produces invalid O'Mega
  matrix element code for SUSY processes with gluino propagators. This
  is fixed in 2.3.1+.

* With gfortran 4.9.1, the auto_components feature (incl. the smtest_5
  self test) does not work in v2.2.2 due to a regression in that compiler.
  This is fixed both in v2.2.3+ of WHIZARD as well as in v4.9.2+ of
  gfortran.

* gfortran 4.9.2 contains several bugs/regressions from GNU's ongoing 
  efforts to implement the Fortran 2008 status. This can lead to
  problems in some of WHIZARD's release versions, though most versions
  include workarounds. Please try to use at least minor version 3 of
  the 4.9.X series.

* MAC OS X Darwin >= 10.11:
  The security measures of the new Darwin systems do not allow e.g.
  environment variables passed to subprocesses. This does not change
  anything for the installed WHIZARD, but the testsuite (make check)
  will not work before make install has been executed. make distcheck 
  will not work on El Capitan. There is also the option to disable
  the System Integrity Protocol (SIP) of El Capitan by booting in
  Recovery Mode, open a terminal and type 'csrutil disable'. However, we
  do not recommend to do so.

Manual:

* WHIZARD 2.4, the new features, is still mostly undocumented.  The manual
  is still quite sparse. We are working on that. Regular updates independent
  from the subreleases can be found on the Hepforge webpage:
