General:

* WHIZARD 2.2 currently runs only with the NAGFOR 5.2 (or newer) and 
  gfortran 4.7.4 (or newer) Fortran compilers

  [After compiler bugs are fixed, it should also run with g95, PGF
   and ifort.  See the file EXTENSIONS for the list of Fortran 2003 
   features that the compiler must support.]

* WHIZARD 2.2 incorporates all features from WHIZARD 1, making the
  legacy branch obsolete now.
  
* Please report bugs and problems or performance issues 
  to our support email address:
  <whizard@desy.de>

Known bugs:

* With gfortran 4.9.1, the auto_components feature (incl. the smtest_5
  self test) does not work in v2.2.2 due to a regression in that compiler.
  This is fixed both in v2.2.3+ of WHIZARD as well as in v4.9.2+ of
  gfortran.

Manual:

* WHIZARD 2.2, the new features, is still mostly undocumented.  The manual
  is still quite sparse. We are working on that. Regular updates independent
  from the subreleases can be found on the Hepforge webpage:
