Known bugs:

General:

* WHIZARD 2.2 currently runs only with the NAGFOR 5.2 (or newer) and 
  gfortran 4.7.1 (or newer) Fortran compilers

  [After compiler bugs are fixed, it should also run with g95, PGF
   and ifort.  See the file EXTENSIONS for the list of Fortran 2003 
   features that the compiler must support.]

* WHIZARD 2.2 incorporates all features from WHIZARD 1, making the
  legacy branch obsolete now.
  
* Please report bugs and problems or performance issues 
  to our support email address:
  <whizard@desy.de>

Manual:

* WHIZARD 2.2, the new features, is still mostly undocumented.  The manual
  is still quite sparse. We are working on that. Regular updates independent
  from the subreleases can be found on the Hepforge webpage:
