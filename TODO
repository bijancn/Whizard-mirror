WHIZARD Core
* Release 2.5
  - large event numbers (still a problem??)

* 2.5
  - EWA implementation (some progress in 2.2.0-2)
  - integration of multiple observables (cf. VAMP)
  - jet finder (partially done)
  - reenabling underlying event 
  
* 2.6
  - Mathematica interface
  - Parton shower matching (MLM done, CKKW pending)
  - GUI extension
  - parallelization (OpenMP done, MPI in progress)
  - Dark Matter
  - Use omega restrictions on diagrams for phase space

* 3.0
  - Tau decay module

Technical stuff
  - include STAT and ERRMSG in allocate and deallocate statements (?)

O'Mega
* 2.5
  - arbitrary Lorentz structure
  - flavor sums
  - model files unification
  - helicity optimization (numerically done/analytically pending)

Models
* Release 2.5 (Zhijie)
  - Tests for 7, 8 fermions ... 

* 2.5
  - W-gamma couplings to resonances
  - W'

VAMP
* 2.5
  - unify naming conventions for types with WHIZARD (JR will do, 
	e.g. type :: division -> division_t (partially done)
* 2.6
  - integration of multiple observables

configure
* 2.5
  - Windows support?

Misc
* Release 2.5
  - Manual + O'Mega Paper (partially done)

* 2.5
  - review gamelan (partially done, esp. docu)




VAMP
* reenable as much PURE and ELEMENTAL as possible and try to make
    the `poor man's elemental procedures' in pmep.nw obsolete.

Longer term:

* replace pointers by allocatable arrays (using deep copy?)

* try to declare WK's PRC_INDEX as OPTIONAL

* try to declare WK's PRC_INDEX more abstractly



CIRCE2
* fix multi channel distributions with singularities at x = 0

* find a better way to test distributions with delta contributions

* update the documentation

* add sensible installcheck for the library (and sample data files)
